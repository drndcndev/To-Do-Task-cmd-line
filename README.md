To-Do Task App (Command Line) - Project Description
Overview
The To-Do Task App is a simple command-line application written in Python that helps users manage their tasks efficiently.

Features

✅ Add Tasks – Users can enter a new task, which will be stored in the task list.

✅ View Tasks – Displays all the tasks currently on the list.

✅ Delete Tasks – Removes a specific task from the list based on user input.

✅ Save Tasks to a File – Saves the task list to a text file (tasks.txt) so that tasks are retained between sessions.


How It Works
The program starts by loading existing tasks from tasks.txt.
The user is presented with a menu to choose actions (Add, View, Delete, Save, or Exit).
When a task is added, it is stored in a list.
The user can delete tasks by selecting the corresponding task number.
The task list can be saved manually or automatically before exiting.
Upon restart, the app retrieves tasks from the file, allowing seamless task management.
